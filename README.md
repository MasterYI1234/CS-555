Research Scenario and Questions:
Scenario: The dataset provided comes from a study of online courses offered by Harvard and MIT through the edX platform since 2012. This dataset includes various attributes related to these courses, such as the number of participants, course content, and completion rates.

Research Questions:
Perform a simple linear regression with Participants and Certified of > 50% Course Content Accessed, and briefly summarize your conclusions?
Calculate the least squares regression equation that predictsParticipants (Course Content Accessed) from `Audited (> 50% Course Content Accessed)`, Certified, `% Audited`,`Total Course Hours (Thousands)`.  Formally test (using the 5-step procedure) whether the set of these predictors is associated with a prestige score at the Î± = 0.05 level?
Assess whether the model assumptions are met.
Are there significant outliers or influential points in the dataset that could skew the results of the analysis?
